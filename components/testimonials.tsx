What stood out was his eagerness to learn and how quickly he absorbed feedback. Beyond engineering, he brought positive energy to the team, organizing an event as our community manager and contributing to content marketing, winning our first Linkedin competition. Anthony has a unique mix of technical ability and creativity, and I'm excited to see where he takes it next.",
