title: "Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript: A Comprehensive Guide"
publishedAt: "2025-11-19"
summary: "I created a comprehensive guide on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript, covering classes, inheritance, interfaces, and more."

Here's a confession: I realized I'd completely skipped over Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript. I'd been writing functional code, using hooks with React, and avoiding classes like they hadn't existed. But when I started diving into OOP patterns, I realized there was a whole paradigm I'd been missing.

The problem? Finding good learning materials was surprisingly hard. So I did what any developer would do; I decided to build my own.

I was working with Claude Code one day when it hit me: this thing is **really** good at writing documentation. Clear, structured, comprehensive. That's when I realized I could use it to create the OOP guide I wished existed.

## The Problem with Current OOP Resources

If you've tried to learn OOP in TypeScript, you've probably noticed the landscape is... sparse. You've got a few options:

- **JavaScript-focused resources** that gloss over TypeScript's type system
- **The TypeScript handbook** which covers the basics but lacks practical exercises
- **Random blog posts** with inconsistent quality and depth

What's missing is a comprehensive, hands-on guide that treats TypeScript as a first-class OOP language—because it is one.

## Building a Better Learning Path

So I built [typescript-oop-guide](https://github.com/ah-materials/typescript-oop-guide), an open-source learning resource that takes you from zero to confident with OOP in TypeScript.

The guide covers 8 core topics:

1. **Real-World Use Cases** - Understanding when and why to use classes
2. **Classes and Objects** - Fundamentals of constructors, methods, and the **this** keyword
3. **Static Members** - The difference between class-level and instance-level
4. **Access Modifiers & Encapsulation** - Public, private, protected, and readonly
5. **Getters and Setters** - Property accessors with built-in validation
6. **Inheritance** - Code reuse through extension and the **super** keyword
7. **Abstract Classes** - Template patterns and enforcing contracts
8. **Interfaces & Polymorphism** - Flexible implementations through contracts

## Learning by Doing: 37 Exercises

Here's where it gets interesting. The guide includes **37 hands-on exercises** distributed across 7 lessons, with difficulty ranging from Easy to Hard.

The first lesson has 7 foundational exercises to get you comfortable with the basics. Then each subsequent lesson has 5 targeted exercises that dive deep into specific OOP concepts.

But here's the key: **there are no solutions provided**. This is intentional. The exercises are designed to push you to reference the study materials, experiment, and actually understand the concepts rather than copy-paste answers. When you're stuck, you go back to the docs, try different approaches, and build real understanding.

## The AI-Assisted Approach

What made this possible was using Claude Code to help structure and write comprehensive documentation. The consistency, clarity, and depth I was able to achieve would have taken weeks of manual writing.

## Open Source and Actively Maintained

The entire guide is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/ah-materials/typescript-oop-guide). You can easily get started by forking the repo, and cloning it locally.

**A note on accuracy**: I'm still going through the exercises myself and testing everything hands-on. There might be some inaccuracies or areas that need improvement. I'm actively maintaining the guide and fixing issues as I find them. **Contributions are absolutely welcome.** If you spot something that's unclear or incorrect, please open an issue or submit a PR.

Learners are encouraged to fork the repo and commit their solutions to their own repositories to track their progress. But if you have suggestions for improving the guide itself, I'd love to hear them.

If you've been struggling with OOP in TypeScript, or you're teaching others and need a structured curriculum, check it out. And if you find it useful, give it a star, it helps others discover it too!
